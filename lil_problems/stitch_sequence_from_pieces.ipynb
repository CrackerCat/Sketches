Finding the root can be done faster (reverse the graph + DFG?), having a separate global dictionary to mark distances to nodes (`trace`) feels wrong (smally code? It's hard to keep it all in mind, that's for sure, which is not a good sign). Also, there's perfectly 0 protection against cycles. If there's a cycle, the `trace` calculator will just loop forever."
