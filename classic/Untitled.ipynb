    "* Terniary (and higher order) trees are apparently also used in practice. Not sure why somebody would do it though. What's the benefit? Not clear.\n",

    " 1. instead of repeatedly running insert(), it's better to just place the list there, and then \"heapify\" it by gowing through all nodes with kids (last//2 and lower), right-to-left, \"sinking\" (swimdown) if necessary\n",
    " 2. then we repeatedly do pop(), and place former max instead of the former last element (so heap scrolls to the left, while sorted array replaces it to the right, all in-place)"
